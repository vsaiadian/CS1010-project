# Phantasm: A simple multi-level puzzle game built using Python's tkinter library. 
"PHANTASM" is short for phantasmagoria â€” a mystical combination of the real and the unreal in the depiction of reality; a jumble of bizarre images, visions, and fantasies. The goal of PHANTASM is to take you on a journey akin to that of the main character: chaotic, grotesque, and confusing.
